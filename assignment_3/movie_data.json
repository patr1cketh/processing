        " I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.",
        " You are so completely unbalanced.",

        " Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?",
        " Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.",
        " You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.",
        " I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.",
        " Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?",
        " Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?",
        " Can you at least start wearing a bra?",
